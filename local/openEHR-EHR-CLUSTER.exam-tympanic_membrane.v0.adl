			use = <"Brukes til å registrere en fritekstbeskrivelse og klinisk tolkning av observerte funn ved fysisk undersøkelse av et spesifisert organsystem eller anatomisk struktur. Denne arketypen består kun av kjerneelementene av mønsteret for undersøkelser, og kan utvides ved hjelp av andre CLUSTER-arketyper eller brukes som grunnlag for undersøkelsesarketyper for spesifikke kroppssystemer eller anatomiske strukturer. 

Eksempler på detaljer som kan beskrives ved hjelp av dette CLUSTER er inspeksjon, palpasjon, auskultasjon, perkusjon og bevegelser i kroppssystemer eller anatomiske strukturer. Undersøkelsen kan støttes av enkle hjelpemidler som stetoskop, otoskop eller reflekshammer. Også funn ved mer avanserte undersøkelser kan registreres her, som ved endoskopi. I de tilfellene vil informasjon om hvilket hjelpemiddel eller utstyr brukt bli registrert i OBSERVATION.exam, elementet \"Detaljer om medisinsk utstyr\", i ACTION.procedure \"Prosedyredetaljer\" eller tilsvarende i egnet ENTRY- eller ACTION-arketype.

Arketypen er laget spesifikt for å brukes i \"Undersøkelsesdetaljer\"-SLOTet i arketypen OBSERVATION.exam, men kan også brukes innen andre ENTRY- og CLUSTER-arketyper der det er klinisk passende.

Denne arketypen kan benyttes for alle typer undersøkelser, alt fra enkle undersøkelser som undersøkelse av et hudområde, inspeksjon av ører og til artroskopi av et kne.

Kan for eksempel nøstes i SLOTet \"Undersøkelsesdetaljer\" i arketypen OBSERVATION.exam (Norsk Funn ved fysisk undersøkelse) for å registrere ytterligere strukturerte funn ved fysiske undersøkelser.

Arketypen CLUSTER.exclusion_exam kan nøstes i SLOTet \"Undersøkelse ikke utført\" der en har behov for å registrere informasjon om at en undersøkelse ikke ble utført.

Brukes for å videreføre fritekstbeskrivelser av kliniske funn fra tidligere systemer inn i et arketypeformat, ved å bruke elementet \"Klinisk beskrivelse\".">
